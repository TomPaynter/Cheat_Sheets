Bullet List:

```latex
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Vibration Isolation:} The flight controller must be isolated with respect the airframe, otherwise the vibrations from the motors in flight can be detected by the IMU causing unnaturally high perceived accelerations and rotations which in-turn create unstable flight.

\item \textbf{Cooling:} The ESCs, any radio transmitters, as well as the flight controllers get considerably warm, as a result the ESCs were placed in the downwash of the rotors and adequate air-flow was provided to the `interior' of the aircraft to cool the flight control boards.

\end{itemize}
